Once upon a time there was a place with a person in it.
The persons had a normal life in that place.
That place had some changes that made life not so normal for that person.
That person went on a journey, made some friends, confronted an adversary, and found out some new stuff.
The person returned back to the place, where everything was normal again, but had a new perspective on things.
